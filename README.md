## Engine
Each player can be a 'Human' or a 'Computer'.
For every 'Human' player the program will ask for a valid move, and for every 'Computer' player the program will compute a move that is in his opinion :) best for current player.
Engine implementation uses:
- iterative deepening
- alpha-beta pruning
- basic heuristic evaluation
## Rules
Ruleset is similar to chess, written in ruleset.txt file.
