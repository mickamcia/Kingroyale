1. We have 4 players:
    red     (left bottom corner)
    green   (right bottom corner)
    yellow  (right top corner)
    blue    (left top corner)

2. Players move in a specific order:
    red -> green -> yellow -> blue
    
3. If a player can not play any move, he skips his turn

4. We distinguish 6 pieces:
    Knight
        regular chess knight

    Bishop
        regular chess bishop

    Rook
        regular chess rook

    Queen
        regular chess queen
        only obtained by pawn promotion

    King
        moves and captures like a regular chess king
        there is no such thing as check; may be captured

    Pawn    
        captures diagonally (one square, all 4 directions)
        can move in all 4 straight lines by one square if empty
        must promote to Queen if in furthest opposite line or column
        (f. e. Red Pawn will promote if in column H or row 8)

5. Last King standing wins!
